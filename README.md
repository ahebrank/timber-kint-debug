# timber-kint-debug
Wordpress plugin for debugging Timber (Twig template) with Kint.
To use this plugin You need Twig for Wordpress (Timber) and plugin to enable Kint support. 
After that you can just write {{ kint() }} or {{ kint(somevariable) }} to debug your template.

Modified from the [original](https://github.com/kaido24/timber-kint-debug) on Jan 2 2018 to add composer for easy inclusion and require kint explicitly.
